## Fish Species Prediction
*This project intends to classify the different species of fish*

For this project we have used the Fish dataset which is available on: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market

**Information about the attributes:**

The dataset includes 159 Rows and 7 columns(1 is dependent variable - species)

**Since species prediction is a classfication based problem hence supervised learning algorithm is used. Hence, for making prediction I have used Logistics Regression only.**

**Types of species dataset has:** 1) Bream, 2) Parkki, 3) Perch, 4) Pike, 5) Roach, 6) Smelt, 7) Whitefish
